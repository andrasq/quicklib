Installation.

Add ./lib to your autoloader paths to locate classes named Quick_*,
else symlink or copy lib/Quick into your existing php libraries tree.

Utilities in bin/ can be copied to your executable path, though you may
have to recompile the binaries to match your architecture.

To run unit tests or Xhprof, get the quicklib extras (or install your own):
clone https://github.com/andrasq/quicklib-ext.git ./ext
