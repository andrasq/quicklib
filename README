Quicklib PHP Toolkit, Version 0.23

This is a toolkit of utilities I started writing while thinking about ways
to process very high volume data streams using PHP.  My goal was to keep
things simple and make them fast, because the speed of the whole is only as
fast as its slowest component(*).

This is a work in progress, but some parts are stable and production ready.
Enjoy!  Hope you find the toolkit useful.
